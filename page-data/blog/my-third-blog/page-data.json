In New York City (NYC), these platforms have become an integral part of the transportation ecosystem. The study focuses on trip records from the <strong>Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)</strong>, spanning from January to May 2021, to analyze fare pricing, demand trends, and geographical classifications across NYC’s boroughs.</p>\n<p>By using this data, we aim to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analyze the factors affecting fare prices</li>\n<li>Predict demand surges</li>\n<li>Categorize NYC boroughs by their ride-hailing characteristics</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Problem Statement</h2>\n<p>Ride-hailing platforms face the challenge of predicting fare prices accurately and efficiently managing driver allocation, particularly in a city as diverse as NYC. Boroughs differ significantly in terms of demand, fare structures, and customer preferences, making it necessary to develop predictive models that address these variabilities.</p>\n<p>To tackle this, the study proposes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A <strong>decision tree regressor</strong> model to predict fare prices using features like trip distance, location, and time.</li>\n<li>The <strong>XGBoost algorithm</strong> to forecast demand trends across the boroughs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Through classification, the boroughs were grouped based on demand, price per mile, and waiting time to offer insights for better operational management.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Approach</h2>\n<h3>Dataset Overview</h3>\n<p>We utilized the <strong>Uber NYC For-Hire Vehicles Trip Data 2021</strong> dataset, available on Kaggle. The dataset contains key details such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trip dates and times</li>\n<li>Pickup and drop-off locations</li>\n<li>Trip distances</li>\n<li>Fare prices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The dataset provides a solid foundation for analyzing ride-hailing dynamics in NYC, allowing us to perform detailed analysis on fare pricing and demand trends.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuhengmo/uber-nyc-forhire-vehicles-trip-data-2021\">Download the dataset here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Model Implementation</h3>\n<h4>Fare Prediction Model</h4>\n<p>The <strong>decision tree regressor</strong> was used to predict fare prices based on factors like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trip miles</li>\n<li>Pickup and drop-off locations</li>\n<li>Time of day</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The model achieved an <strong>R-squared value of 0.81</strong>, explaining 81% of the variance in fare prices. This result demonstrates the model’s accuracy in predicting fares based on the input variables.</p>\n<h4>Demand Forecasting Model</h4>\n<p>To forecast demand, the <strong>XGBoost algorithm</strong> was used, with features such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Day of the week</li>\n<li>Hour of the day</li>\n<li>Trip history patterns</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The model achieved an <strong>RMSE value of 2100</strong>, indicating a good level of accuracy in predicting demand surges.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<h3>Fare Prediction Results</h3>\n<p>The fare prediction model’s performance was evaluated using actual and predicted values, demonstrating high accuracy in predicting fare prices. Below is a comparison of <strong>actual vs. predicted fare prices</strong>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/static/blog/6895fb359ebb75a94cffdf1e2f05521d/results_regression.png\" alt=\"Fare Price Prediction\">\n<em>Figure 1: CDF of Absolute Residuals for the Fare Price Prediction Model.</em></p>\n<p>Approximately 80% of the predictions have an error margin of -5.19 to 5.19, which showcases the model’s precision.</p>\n<h3>Demand Forecasting Results</h3>\n<p>Below is a graph comparing actual and predicted demand values, showcasing the model’s forecasting accuracy:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/static/blog/df0b46b4b3dfdcbe013fd7f3730204f0/results_forecasting.png\" alt=\"Forecasting Model\">\n<em>Figure 2: Actual vs. Predicted Values for the Forecasting Model.</em></p>\n<p>The model shows that it can accurately predict surges in demand, which is crucial for better resource allocation in ride-hailing services.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Comparative Analysis Across Ride-Hailing Platforms</h2>\n<p>We compared operational metrics of <strong>Uber, Lyft, and Via</strong> across different distance bins, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mean fare price</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Driver pay</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Waiting times</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/static/blog/6f91d1ccd9b8f8e1b2881dcceddcadd8/driver_pay_fare_price.png\" alt=\"Mean Fare Price\">\n<em>Figure 3: Mean Fare Price and Driver Pay Across Distance Intervals.</em></p>\n<p>Uber and Lyft are seen to offer higher driver compensation and lower fare prices compared to Via, which explains Uber’s market dominance.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Borough Classification</h2>\n<p>The study also grouped NYC boroughs into four distinct clusters based on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of trips per pickup and drop-off locations</li>\n<li>Waiting times</li>\n<li>Price-to-mile ratio</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/static/blog/5e49fafdfc694adaa5667967fa0f11de/newy_yorkclass.png\" alt=\"Borough Clustering\">\n<em>Figure 4: Map of New York City with Clusters.</em></p>\n<p>This clustering helps better understand the transportation dynamics in each borough and can guide strategic resource allocation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This study provided insights into ride-hailing services in NYC, with key takeaways including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accurate fare price prediction using a decision tree regressor model.</li>\n<li>Reliable demand forecasting using XGBoost.</li>\n<li>Comparative analysis of ride-hailing platforms showing Uber’s competitive edge.</li>\n<li>Borough classification offering actionable insights for resource management.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ride-Hailing Trends in New York City ( Uber, Lyft, and Via ) Operations Analysis","date":"June 01, 2023","description":"In this post, I cover the analysis of ride-hailing services in New York City, focusing on fare pricing and demand trends.
