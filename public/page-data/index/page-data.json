Logistics services face challenges such as a narrow driver pool and time-consuming manual matching when no drivers are available. To address these, I developed a two-tower recommender system that efficiently matches drivers to vehicle transfer requests by ranking drivers based on suitability. This approach is expected to increase driver engagement by 40% and reduce operational costs by 19%, streamlining the entire process while reducing manual interventions."}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Introduction In modern computational tasks, white noise generation and processing are fundamental in various fields, from signal processing…","fields":{"slug":"/blog/my-second-blog/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"January 11, 2024","title":"Enhancing Execution Speed of White Noise Generation through Parallelization and Vectorization","description":"In this post, I discuss the optimization of white noise generation and FFT processing using parallelization with OpenMP and vectorization with AVX2 instructions. White noise generation and FFT operations are computationally intensive, especially when processing large datasets. The initial sequential code took 70 seconds to execute. By applying parallelization and vectorization techniques, I reduced the execution time to 10 seconds, achieving a 7x speedup. This study demonstrates how combining multi-core and SIMD optimizations can significantly improve computational efficiency in FFT-based tasks."}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Introduction As computing technology advances, modern microprocessors are becoming more powerful, consuming up to 200 watts of power or more…","fields":{"slug":"/blog/my-first-blog/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"November 23, 2023","title":"Parallelization Strategies for Numerical Simulation of Heat Transfer in CPU Heatsinks","description":"In this post, I share insights from my research on parallelizing simulations for CPU heatsink heat transfer. I explored two parallelization techniques—1D slicing along the Z-axis and 2D slicing along the Z and Y axes—to efficiently model heat dissipation in a 3D grid structure. By leveraging MPI for communication between processors and implementing non-blocking communication, I significantly improved performance, achieving up to 5.63x speedup with 32 processors.

Using trip data from NYC’s Taxi and Limousine Commission, I built models to predict fare prices with a decision tree regressor and forecast demand surges using the XGBoost algorithm. The fare prediction model achieved an R-squared value of 0.81, while the demand forecasting model produced accurate results with an RMSE of 2100. The study also classified NYC boroughs based on ride-hailing characteristics, providing actionable insights for better resource management."}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
