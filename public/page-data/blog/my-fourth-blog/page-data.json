These services, crucial to keeping automotive supply chains running smoothly, rely on a unique workforce—independent drivers who, although not full-time employees, are essential to the system’s operation. But what happens when these drivers become scarce or inefficiencies emerge in matching the right driver to the right transport?</p>\n<p>For many in this field, manually assigning drivers to vehicle transfers has become a daily struggle. The challenge? Finding the perfect driver for each job while minimizing delays, costs, and manual interventions. </p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Problem Statement</h2>\n<p>Consider the platform where customers post vehicle transfer requests, waiting for drivers to step up and apply. Ideally, it should run smoothly: customer posts a request, driver picks it up, and the vehicle gets moved on time. But reality doesn’t always follow that script. When transfer deadlines loom without a driver assigned, service operators must step in manually—a process that drains time and resources.</p>\n<p>Two central issues have emerged from this model:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A Narrow Driver Pool</strong>: The focus on high-precision driver selection has inadvertently reduced the available pool of drivers, limiting flexibility and giving a small group too much leverage. This not only increases costs but also makes the entire system fragile when drivers are unavailable.</li>\n<li><strong>Manual Processes</strong>: As deadlines approach, if no driver has been assigned, teams must manually match drivers to requests—an approach that doesn’t scale well, leading to inefficiency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These challenges called for an innovative solution—one that could optimize both the efficiency of driver matching and the cost-effectiveness of the system.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>The Solution: A Two-Tower Recommender System</h2>\n<p>To address these problems, we developed a <strong>two-tower recommender system</strong>, designed to transform the way drivers are matched to transfer requests. This system evaluates drivers’ suitability for specific transfers, narrowing the search space to just 100 top-ranked drivers—representing only 2% of the total driver pool. Impressively, the system ranks unsuitable drivers beyond the top 100 in 93% of cases, ensuring precision without sacrificing speed.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Expected Outcomes</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increased Engagement</strong>: Based on the model tests, we anticipate a significant boost in driver engagement, with up to 40% of drivers interacting with the system—doubling the engagement rate compared to the previous system’s 20%.</li>\n<li><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong>: The model also predicts notable cost savings. By expanding the driver pool and fostering competition, operational costs are expected to drop by as much as 19%, a slight improvement over the previously estimated 18% reduction.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: space-between;\">\n  <div style=\"flex: 1; text-align: center; margin-right: 10px;\">\n    <h4>Driver's Diversity vs. Number of Transfers</h4>\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; margin: 0 0 30px;\">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/5436e61de6ac29f74e72356afd79697f/39a20/compar.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 60.810810810810814%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Driver's Diversity vs. Number of Transfers\" title=\"Driver's Diversity vs. Number of Transfers\" src=\"/static/5436e61de6ac29f74e72356afd79697f/fcda8/compar.png\" srcset=\"/static/5436e61de6ac29f74e72356afd79697f/12f09/compar.png 148w,\n/static/5436e61de6ac29f74e72356afd79697f/e4a3f/compar.png 295w,\n/static/5436e61de6ac29f74e72356afd79697f/fcda8/compar.png 590w,\n/static/5436e61de6ac29f74e72356afd79697f/39a20/compar.png 859w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"flex: 1; text-align: center;\">\n    <h4>Price Variation: Booking vs. Minimum (%)</h4>\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; margin: 0 0 30px;\">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/083efad76cc79784181394ec6d7380eb/77800/offic_margin.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 61.48648648648649%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Price Variation Analysis\" title=\"Price Variation Analysis\" src=\"/static/083efad76cc79784181394ec6d7380eb/fcda8/offic_margin.png\" srcset=\"/static/083efad76cc79784181394ec6d7380eb/12f09/offic_margin.png 148w,\n/static/083efad76cc79784181394ec6d7380eb/e4a3f/offic_margin.png 295w,\n/static/083efad76cc79784181394ec6d7380eb/fcda8/offic_margin.png 590w,\n/static/083efad76cc79784181394ec6d7380eb/77800/offic_margin.png 855w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h2>How It Works</h2>\n<p>At the heart of this solution lies the two-tower architecture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Driver Tower</strong> processes driver attributes, converting them into high-dimensional embeddings that encapsulate their preferences and past performance.</li>\n<li><strong>The Request Tower</strong> analyzes the specific details of each transfer request—such as pickup and drop-off locations—and similarly generates embeddings that represent the nature of the request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These two towers work in harmony, calculating the cosine similarity between driver and request embeddings, effectively ranking drivers based on their fit for each transfer.
