## Introduction

Vehicle transportation services face an increasingly complex logistics environment, with a growing need to move single vehicles across various destinations efficiently. Operating with a network of over 7,000 independent drivers, these services rely on drivers who are not direct employees but are integral to the system. A major challenge for these services is matching the right drivers to the right transportation requests while minimizing manual intervention.

## Problem Statement

Customers use the platform to post vehicle transfer requests, and drivers apply for these transfers. When the transfer date approaches without a driver assignment, manual intervention becomes necessary. This reliance on a limited pool of drivers has led to several issues:

- **Narrow Driver Pool**: The existing system focuses on high precision, limiting the driver pool. This reduces flexibility, increases operational costs, and grants disproportionate bargaining power to a small group of drivers.
- **Manual Processes**: As deadlines approach without an assigned driver, the process requires manual effort, which hinders scalability and efficiency.

## Achieved Results

We developed a two-tower recommender system that ranks drivers by their suitability for a given transfer. This system narrows the search space to approximately 100 drivers, around 2% of the original pool. The system ensures that in 93% of cases, unsuitable drivers are ranked beyond the top 100.

- **Engagement**: The recommender system doubled driver engagement, reaching 40% of drivers compared to the 20% in the previous system.
- **Cost Reduction**: By expanding the driver pool and increasing competition, costs are reduced by up to 19%. This is a significant improvement over the baseline 18% reduction.

## Approach

The two-tower recommender system automates and optimizes the matching of drivers with vehicle transfer requests. This reduces the need for manual intervention and mitigates last-minute price adjustments. The system consists of two main components:

- **Driver Tower**: This component processes driver attributes and converts them into high-dimensional embeddings that represent their preferences.
- **Request Tower**: It processes transfer request details, such as pickup and drop-off locations, converting these into embeddings that represent the requestâ€™s characteristics.

The similarity between these embeddings is computed using cosine similarity, which ranks drivers based on their compatibility with the request.
